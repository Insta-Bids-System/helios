# Helios Project - Major Update: Supabase Integration & Monitoring System

## Summary
This commit represents a significant milestone in the Helios project, adding comprehensive monitoring capabilities through Supabase integration while maintaining all existing agent orchestration functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. Supabase Integration
- Added Supabase as a secondary persistence layer for monitoring
- Created comprehensive schema with tables for:
  - Projects tracking
  - Workflows management
  - Agent activity logs
  - Agent performance metrics
  - Monitoring dashboard view
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Added real-time subscription capabilities

### 2. Monitoring System
- New monitoring routes at `/api/monitor/*`
- Global agent activity tracking endpoint
- Project-specific monitoring with detailed metrics
- Real-time event streaming via SSE
- Integration with Supabase for persistent storage

### 3. Enhanced Backend Services
- Created `supabase.ts` service with helper functions
- Added monitoring routes with comprehensive error handling
- Updated docker-compose with Supabase environment variables
- Added test scripts for Supabase connection validation

### 4. Documentation
- Added SUPABASE_SETUP.md with detailed setup instructions
- Created DATABASE_MONITORING.md explaining the monitoring architecture
- Added SQL schema files for easy deployment

### 5. Dependencies
- Added @supabase/supabase-js for Supabase client
- Added dotenv for environment variable management
- Updated package.json with new dependencies

## Technical Details

### New Environment Variables
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- SUPABASE_DB_URL

### New API Endpoints
- GET /api/monitor/agents - View all agent activity
- GET /api/monitor/projects/:id - Monitor specific project
- GET /api/monitor/stream/:projectId - Real-time SSE stream

### Database Changes
- Maintained existing PostgreSQL schema in helios namespace
- Added Supabase schema with monitoring-specific tables
- Dual database architecture for separation of concerns

## Testing
- All endpoints tested and working
- Supabase connection verified
- Real-time subscriptions functional
- Test data successfully inserted and queried

## Next Steps
- Implement frontend dashboard (Phase 1.7)
- Add authentication to monitoring endpoints
- Enhance agent implementations with actual logic
- Create visualization components for monitoring data

## Breaking Changes
None - All existing functionality remains intact

## Migration Notes
1. Run supabase-schema.sql in Supabase SQL editor
2. Update .env with Supabase credentials
3. Restart backend container to load new environment variables
