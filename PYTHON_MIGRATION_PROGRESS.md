# TypeScript to Python Migration Progress

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Project Structure
- Created Python backend package structure at `packages/backend-python/`
- Set up Poetry for dependency management
- Created all required directories following blueprint structure

### 2. Configuration & Settings
- Implemented Pydantic-based settings management
- Created `.env.example` with all configuration options
- Migrated from Winston to loguru for Python logging

### 3. Core Components (Following Helios Blueprint)
- **Task 1.3**: Created HeliosSwarmState, AgentNode, and OrchestratorGraph
- **Task 1.4**: Implemented swarm router logic in OrchestratorGraph
- **Task 1.5**: Created FileSystemManager with atomic write operations
- **Database Schema**: Migrated PostgreSQL schema (Task 1.2)

### 4. API Layer
- Migrated from Express.js to FastAPI
- Implemented health check endpoints
- Created project creation endpoint (Task 4.1)
- Integrated Socket.IO for real-time updates

### 5. Database Layer
- Migrated from pg to asyncpg for async PostgreSQL
- Created connection pool management
- Maintained same schema structure

### 6. Docker Configuration
- Created Python-specific Dockerfile
- Added docker-compose.python.yml for Python backend

## Next Steps ðŸš€

### Phase 2: Agent Implementation
Following the blueprint, we need to implement:

1. **Task 2.1**: ProductManagerAgent with Generateâ†’Validateâ†’Correct loop
2. **Task 2.2**: Handoff mechanism (createHandoffTool)
3. **Task 2.3**: BackendEngineerAgent with code generation
4. **Task 3.1**: QAEngineerAgent with test generation
5. **Task 3.2**: Self-correction loop integration

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
- Implement the `call_llm(prompt, tools)` placeholder function
- Add support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Phase 4: Additional Services
- Migrate any remaining TypeScript services
- Implement background task processing
- Add comprehensive error handling

## Key Differences from TypeScript Version

1. **Async Pattern**: Using Python's native async/await with asyncio
2. **Type System**: Leveraging Python's type hints with mypy
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - Express â†’ FastAPI
   - Winston â†’ loguru
   - pg â†’ asyncpg
   - TypeScript interfaces â†’ Pydantic models
4. **Package Management**: npm/yarn â†’ Poetry
5. **Code Style**: Following PEP 8 and Python conventions

## Testing Migration
To test the Python backend:

```bash
cd packages/backend-python
poetry install
docker-compose -f ../../docker-compose.python.yml up
```

## Notes
- All core architectural patterns from the blueprint are preserved
- The Python implementation follows the same state-based communication model
- File system operations maintain the same atomic guarantees
- Database schema remains identical for compatibility
