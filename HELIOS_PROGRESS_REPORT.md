#### 3. Next Task & Prompt:

**Next Task:** Execute Phase 1.7: Frontend Dashboard Implementation

**Prompt for Next Session:**
"Using the helios_master_prompt_v3 blueprint as our guide, implement Task 1.7: Frontend Dashboard Implementation. Create a React-based dashboard that:

1. Connects to the backend via Socket.io
2. Displays project list and status
3. Shows real-time agent execution progress
4. Visualizes the agent graph and current active agent
5. Displays tasks and artifacts as they're created

The dashboard should include:
- Project creation form
- Project list view with status indicators
- Project detail view with:
  - Agent execution visualization
  - Task progress tracking
  - Artifact viewer
  - Real-time logs
- Socket.io integration for live updates

Create/update these files in packages/frontend/src/:
- components/ProjectList.tsx
- components/ProjectCreate.tsx
- components/ProjectDetail.tsx
- components/AgentGraph.tsx
- services/api.ts
- services/socket.ts
- Update App.tsx to include routing

After implementing, provide the updated HELIOS_PROGRESS_REPORT.md."

#### 4. Technical Notes:

**Architectural Decisions:**

1. **OrchestratorAgent Design**:
   - Asynchronous execution pattern for non-blocking API responses
   - Event-driven communication for real-time updates
   - Separation of concerns between orchestration and agent logic
   - Flexible agent registration system

2. **API Design**:
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - WebSocket integration for real-time features
   - Consistent error handling and response formats
   - Stateless request handling with persistent orchestrators

3. **State Management**:
   - Active orchestrators stored in memory
   - Database as source of truth for project state
   - Event emitters for internal communication
   - Socket.io for external broadcasting

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Try-catch blocks at all levels
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - Detailed error logging
   - Client-friendly error messages

**Performance Considerations:**
- Non-blocking async operations throughout
- Connection pooling for database
- Event batching for high-frequency updates
- Efficient memory management for active orchestrators

**Security Considerations:**
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Project isolation
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Database query parameterization

**Next Implementation Considerations:**
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Project queuing system
- Resource usage monitoring
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
