**Phase 1.2: Persistence Layer (Database Schema)** ✓
* Created comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema with the following tables:
  - **projects**: Core table for storing project information with UUID primary keys
  - **tasks**: Stores decomposed tasks with dependencies array and status tracking
  - **artifacts**: Version-controlled file storage with content and metadata
  - **agent_logs**: Comprehensive logging system with JSONB action details

  - Database logging integration
  - Socket.io-based communication
  - Generate → Validate → Correct pattern support
  - Status management and event emission
* Created AgentRegistry for managing agent instances:
  - Registration/unregistration of agents
  - Lookup by ID, role, or project
  - Statistics and monitoring capabilities
  - Project-level shutdown functionality
* Implemented handoff tools system:
  - createHandoffTool function for explicit control transfer
  - Pre-defined handoff tools for common transitions
  - Conditional handoffs based on validation results
  - Task-based handoffs with assignment

**Phase 1.5: The Swarm Router (The Brain)** ✓
* Implemented intelligent routing logic within OrchestratorGraph:
  - **Explicit routing**: Via nextAgent field in state
  - **Conditional routing**: Based on project requirements
  - **Dynamic agent selection**: Fullstack vs separate Frontend/Backend
  - **Error recovery**: Alternative agent routing on failures
  - **Review loops**: Code review failure triggers re-work
  - **Integration decisions**: Based on artifact complexity
* Routing decision points:
  - Product Manager → Frontend/Backend/Fullstack (based on project type)
  - Engineers → DevOps (if deployment required) → QA
  - QA → Code Reviewer
  - Code Reviewer → Engineers (if fixes needed) or Integration Specialist
  - Integration Specialist → Completion

#### 3. Current System Status:

**✅ Working Features:**
1. **Project Creation**: Natural language input creates projects in database
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket communication fully functional
3. **UI Framework**: Three-panel chat interface operational
4. **Docker Setup**: All services running (PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend, Frontend)
5. **API Endpoints**: All REST endpoints functional
6. **Database**: Projects stored and retrieved correctly

**⏳ Placeholder Features (Awaiting Phase 1.8):**
1. **Task Creation**: Agents generate tasks but don't persist to database
2. **Agent Intelligence**: All agents return placeholder responses
3. **Code Generation**: No actual code is generated yet
4. **Artifact Creation**: No files are created or stored
5. **Real Agent Activity**: Agent status is static, not dynamic

**🐛 Known Issues:**
1. Tasks don't appear in UI (not saved to database)
2. Artifacts tab shows blank (no artifacts generated)
3. Agent activity is hardcoded (not reflecting actual work)
4. No LLM integration (agents have no intelligence)

#### 4. Next Task & Prompt:

**Next Task:** Execute Phase 1.8: Agent Logic Implementation with LLM Integration

**Prompt for Next Session:**
"Continue with the Helios project at Phase 1.8. The chat-driven UI is complete and working. Now implement actual agent intelligence:

1. **Add LLM Integration**:
   - Integrate OpenAI/Claude API for agent intelligence
   - Update .env with LLM configuration
   - Create LLM service wrapper

2. **Implement Task Persistence**:
   - Save generated tasks to database
   - Update task status as agents work
   - Create proper task dependencies

3. **Enhance Agent Logic**:
   - ProductManagerAgent: Use LLM to decompose requirements
   - Engineers: Generate actual code files
   - QA: Create real test cases
   - DevOps: Generate deployment configurations

4. **Artifact Generation**:
   - Save generated code to artifacts table
   - Create actual files in workspace directory
   - Version control for artifacts

5. **Real-time Agent Activity**:
   - Update agent status dynamically
   - Show actual progress in UI
   - Log all agent actions

The UI is ready to display everything - we just need to make the agents actually do their work!"

#### 5. Technical Notes:

**Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Chat-Driven Interface**: More intuitive than forms for AI interaction
2. **Three-Panel Layout**: Maximizes information density while maintaining clarity
3. **Real-time Visualization**: Essential for understanding agent behavior
4. **Docker-First**: Ensures consistent development environment

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Environment variables need explicit loading in docker-compose
2. Frontend dependencies must be installed in containers
3. Database queries should match actual schema
4. Port conflicts need careful management

**Performance Considerations:**
1. WebSocket connections for real-time updates
2. Efficient task polling to avoid overload
3. Lazy loading for large artifact content
4. Query optimization for task dependencies
