#### 1. Completed Tasks & Milestones:

**Phase 0: GitHub Repository Setup** ✓
* Initialized monorepo structure with workspaces for backend and frontend packages
* Created root package.json with npm workspaces configuration and scripts
* Defined docker-compose.yml for three services: Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis instance
* Set up backend package with Express.js, TypeScript, Socket.io, pg, and redis dependencies
* Set up frontend package with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
* Created initial TypeScript configurations for both packages
* Added .env.example with all necessary environment variables
* Created basic Express server with health check endpoint and Socket.io integration
* Set up React application with Tailwind CSS and initial UI structure
* Added logging configuration with Winston
* Created database connection pool configuration
* Added Dockerfiles for containerized development
* Included comprehensive .gitignore and README.md
* Initialized Git repository and made initial commit
* Pushed project to GitHub repository: https://github.com/Insta-Bids-System/helios

**Phase 1.2: Persistence Layer (Database Schema)** ✓
* Created comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema with the following tables:
  - **projects**: Core table for storing project information with UUID primary keys
  - **tasks**: Stores decomposed tasks with dependencies array and status tracking
  - **artifacts**: Version-controlled file storage with content and metadata
  - **agent_logs**: Comprehensive logging system with JSONB action details
* Implemented advanced database features:
  - UUID generation using uuid-ossp extension
  - Dedicated helios schema for namespace isolation
  - Comprehensive indexes for query optimization
  - Foreign key relationships with CASCADE DELETE
  - Check constraints for status validation
  - Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
  - Artifact versioning system with automatic is_latest management
  - Helper views for common query patterns (v_active_projects, v_task_dependencies)
  - JSONB columns with GIN indexes for flexible data storage
* Added extensive documentation through SQL comments
* Included performance optimizations and best practices

**Phase 1.3: Agent Configuration & Base Classes** ✓
* Created comprehensive TypeScript type system for agents:
  - **IAgent interface**: Core contract for all agents
  - **AgentRole enum**: Defines all agent types (Orchestrator, ProductManager, Engineers, QA, etc.)
  - **AgentStatus enum**: Agent lifecycle states (IDLE, EXECUTING, WAITING, ERROR, COMPLETED)
  - **HeliosSwarmState interface**: Central state object for agent coordination
  - **Message types**: AgentMessage, AgentResponse for inter-agent communication
* Implemented BaseAgent abstract class with:
  - Core properties: id, role, projectId, status
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Database logging integration
  - Socket.io-based communication
  - Generate → Validate → Correct pattern support
  - Status management and event emission
* Created AgentRegistry for managing agent instances:
  - Registration/unregistration of agents
  - Lookup by ID, role, or project
  - Statistics and monitoring capabilities
  - Project-level shutdown functionality
* Implemented handoff tools system:
  - createHandoffTool function for explicit control transfer
  - Pre-defined handoff tools for common transitions
  - Conditional handoffs based on validation results
  - Task-based handoffs with assignment
* Updated Express server with:
  - Agent Registry initialization
  - AgentContext creation for dependency injection
  - Socket.io namespaces for agent communication (/agents)
  - Socket.io namespace for project monitoring (/projects)
  - Enhanced health endpoint with agent statistics
  - Graceful shutdown with agent cleanup

**Phase 1.4: Core State and Graph Definitions** ✓
* Enhanced HeliosSwarmState interface with:
  - Complete project tracking fields
  - Task management with dependencies
  - Artifact version control support
  - Agent-specific state storage
  - Error tracking and recovery
  - Execution metadata (completed, finalOutput, nextAgent)
* Created AgentNode class:
  - Extends BaseAgent for consistent behavior
  - Supports custom execute and validate functions
  - Implements role-specific default behaviors
  - Provides Generate → Validate → Correct pattern
  - Includes smart routing decisions based on state
* Implemented OrchestratorGraph class:
  - Manages collection of AgentNodes
  - Main run() method for execution loop
  - State management with partial updates
  - Event-driven architecture for monitoring
  - Execution history tracking
  - Error handling and recovery strategies

**Phase 1.5: The Swarm Router (The Brain)** ✓
* Implemented intelligent routing logic within OrchestratorGraph:
  - **Explicit routing**: Via nextAgent field in state
  - **Conditional routing**: Based on project requirements
  - **Dynamic agent selection**: Fullstack vs separate Frontend/Backend
  - **Error recovery**: Alternative agent routing on failures
  - **Review loops**: Code review failure triggers re-work
  - **Integration decisions**: Based on artifact complexity
* Routing decision points:
  - Product Manager → Frontend/Backend/Fullstack (based on project type)
  - Engineers → DevOps (if deployment required) → QA
  - QA → Code Reviewer
  - Code Reviewer → Engineers (if fixes needed) or Integration Specialist
  - Integration Specialist → Completion
* Smart routing features:
  - Project description analysis for agent selection
  - Failure recovery with alternative agents
  - Conditional integration based on complexity
  - Review-based iteration loops

#### 3. Next Task & Prompt:

**Next Task:** Execute Phase 1.6: Orchestrator Agent Implementation

**Prompt for Next Session:**
"Using the helios_master_prompt_v3 blueprint as our guide, implement Task 1.6: Orchestrator Agent Implementation. Create a concrete OrchestratorAgent that:

1. Extends the BaseAgent class
2. Uses the OrchestratorGraph internally
3. Handles project initialization and decomposition
4. Manages the overall swarm execution
5. Provides project status and monitoring capabilities

The OrchestratorAgent should:
- Initialize projects in the database
- Create and manage the OrchestratorGraph instance
- Handle high-level project commands (start, pause, resume, status)
- Emit events for project lifecycle
- Provide methods for adding custom agents
- Support project completion and cleanup

Create these files in packages/backend/src/agents/:
- OrchestratorAgent.ts
- Update the agents/index.ts to export the new agent

Also create a simple REST API endpoint to interact with the orchestrator:
- routes/projects.ts (with endpoints for creating and managing projects)

After implementing, provide the updated HELIOS_PROGRESS_REPORT.md."

#### 4. Technical Notes:

**Architectural Decisions:**

1. **State Management**:
   - Centralized HeliosSwarmState for consistency
   - Partial state updates for efficiency
   - Agent-specific state storage for flexibility
   - Immutable state reads for safety

2. **Routing Intelligence**:
   - Project description parsing for agent selection
   - Dynamic routing based on execution results
   - Error recovery with fallback agents
   - Conditional integration based on complexity metrics

3. **Event-Driven Design**:
   - EventEmitter for real-time monitoring
   - Socket.io integration for client updates
   - Comprehensive event logging
   - Performance metrics collection

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Multi-level error recovery
   - Alternative agent routing
   - Detailed error logging
   - Graceful degradation

**Performance Considerations:**
- Async/await throughout for non-blocking execution
- Efficient state merging algorithms
- Database connection pooling
- Event batching for high-frequency updates

**Security Considerations:**
- Input validation at agent level
- State isolation between projects
- Secure Socket.io namespaces
- Database query parameterization

**Next Implementation Considerations:**
- WebSocket authentication for project monitoring
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Project queue management
- Resource allocation strategies
- Metrics and monitoring dashboard
